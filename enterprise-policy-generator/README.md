## Enterprise policy descriptions and templates for Thunderbird

While the templates for the most recent version of Thunderbird will probably also work with older releases of Thunderbird, they may contain new policies which are not supported in older releases. We suggest to use the templates which correspond to the highest version of Thunderbird you are actually deploying.

 * [Thunderbird (active development)](/templates/central)
 * [Thunderbird 91 (and older)](/templates/esr91) (v3.1) 
 * [Thunderbird 78 (and older)](/templates/esr78) (v2.12) 
 * [Thunderbird 68](/templates/esr68) (v1.17)
